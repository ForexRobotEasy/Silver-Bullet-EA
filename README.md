## Description

The Silver Bullet EA 3.0 is an expert advisor (EA) that automates forex trading using a specific entry model. The EA includes three entry models: Continuation Entry, Reversal Entry, and Classic Entry. The entry model to be used can be selected using the `SelectEntryModel` function.

The EA works by analyzing the previous high, previous low, and current price to determine the appropriate entry and execute trades accordingly. The entry models are implemented as separate functions: `ContinuationEntry`, `ReversalEntry`, and `ClassicEntry`.

The `ContinuationEntry` function executes a trade in the same direction if the current price is above the previous high or below the previous low. The `ReversalEntry` function seeks liquidity levels taken from either above or below the previous high/low and executes trades at those levels. The `ClassicEntry` function allows for a custom entry strategy to be implemented.

The `OnTick` event handler is responsible for calling the appropriate entry model function based on the selected entry model. It retrieves the previous high, previous low, and current price, and then executes the trade accordingly.

The `OnInit` function initializes the trade object and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization. The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is deactivated and is responsible for cleaning up the trade object.

The `OnStart` function sets up the trade parameters, such as expert magic number, margin mode, deviation in points, and type filling. It also registers the `OnTick` event handler.

## Product Description

The Silver Bullet EA 3.0 is an expert advisor that enhances forex trades using the ICT strategy. It incorporates three entry models: Continuation Entry, Reversal Entry, and Classic Entry. Each entry model is designed to capture different market conditions and execute trades accordingly.

The Continuation Entry model identifies situations where the current price surpasses the previous high or falls below the previous low. In such cases, the EA executes trades in the same direction.

The Reversal Entry model seeks liquidity levels taken from either above or below the previous high/low. It places buy stop and sell stop orders at these liquidity levels, allowing for potential trade execution.

The Classic Entry model provides flexibility for traders to implement their own custom entry strategy. The example code provided executes trades when the current price crosses above the previous high.

The Silver Bullet EA 3.0 is a powerful tool for traders looking to automate their forex trading using the ICT strategy. It offers multiple entry models to capture different market conditions and execute trades accordingly.
